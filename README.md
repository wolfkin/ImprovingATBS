# Improving on Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

As I've undertaking the task of teaching myself python I find the examples in the book/video to be a bit.. odd. I've done some basic in elementary school way back when and I've done some C++ and Java and I consider myself to be somewhat versed in programming techniques. 

This is a repo where I'll be storing my adaptions of the examples we undertake in ATBS. I might revisit them with some of the advanced techniques as I learn them and practice using them in a controlled environment.

Ideas:
1. Documentation in a group program bring back the carnival game I made in c++. allowing the user to pick the original or improved versions
